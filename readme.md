## Boilerplate with Boilersuit

This is a simple folk of [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate), except it comes with [boilersuit](https://github.com/mattpocock/boilersuit) built in.

Generating a new container with generate a new suit file, and running `npm run suit` or `yarn suit` will fill out the suit files.
